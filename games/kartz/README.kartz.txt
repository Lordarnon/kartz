Kartz
=====

Kartz is a fully realised 3D racing game that allows the player to race a
go-kart against three AI controlled opponents.

The game demonstrates some of the higher level Marmalade Studio APIs
including IwResManager for resource loading and management, and
IwGraphics for rendering 3D models.  It also shows how to use the Derbh
archive system to compress the required assets and thus reduce the size
of the final deployment package.
