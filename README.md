This repo contains a branch of kartz and the GameFramework as of ade/f2
c362764 (which will be identical to main at the same revision date).
The root folder for this repo is effectively the examples folder from the
SDK.  

This branch should be viewed as main, i.e. the code here is sacrosant.
If you want to work on improving kartz or just messing with it then
fork this branch and do what you like.  If the improvements are cool then
we can integrate back to this main branch and then ultimately the SDK.
